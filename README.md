# fake-news-detection-
The site works on all devices but only works if your jupyter model is working on your own device.
This is a project for fake news detection and contains the website's code. This machine-learning project determines whether a news article is fake or real. I have created the machine learning model on the jupyter notebook, and the website has been created using anvil uplink, an online cloud-based service. The machine learning models used in the project are -

The methodologies used are Classification and regression. 

Logistic Regression: 
Random Forest Classifier: 
TensorFlow:

Datasets - 
The dimensions for the true dataset are - (21417, 5) - used in fake news model
The dimensions for the false dataset are -(23481, 4) - used in fake news model
The dimensions for the news dataset are - (7796,3) - only used tensor flow model
Total data points -  248,163

Website - 
The website of the project has been made using an anvil uplink server. You can watch online tutorials explaining how to deploy jupyter notebook to the Anvil uplink server. There are different buttons and text; you can design a webpage quite quickly compared to using HTML or CSS. I have uploaded the code used in the Anvil server to create the website and uploaded the code on the jupyter notebook. The output on the website is only through logistic regression and random forest classifier. The tensor flow jupyter notebook has yet to be deployed on the website.
